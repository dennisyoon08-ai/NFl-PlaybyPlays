CW-WPA: Clutch-Weighted Win Probability Added (NFL, Java)
What this project does

This project creates a custom football impact metric, CW-WPA, by computing each play’s Win Probability Added (WPA) and weighting it more heavily in high-pressure situations (late + close games).

Data

NFL play-by-play (2015) CSV

Source: Kaggle (linked)

Dataset is not included in repo (see Setup)

Methods

Bin-based Win Probability model using historical outcomes:

bins by score differential and time remaining

Compute WPA per play: WPA = WP_now - WP_prev

Define clutch pressure weight:

increases when game is late and close

Custom metric:

CW-WPA = Σ WPA * (1 + λ * clutchWeight)

Results

outputs/leaderboard_wpa.csv

outputs/leaderboard_cwwpa.csv

outputs/report.txt (case studies + correlation + overlap)

How to run

Download dataset and place as data/pbp.csv

Compile and run:

javac src/*.java

java -cp src Main

Validation

Correlation between WPA and CW-WPA

Top-10 overlap comparison

2 case studies showing why rankings change

Limitations / Next steps

Player credit assignment can be improved

Possession inference could be refined

Extend to multiple seasons
